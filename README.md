### Notes
---
Working with sequelize proved difficult due to limited documentation, but it did save work where it could be applied.

In the future we hope to added the following capabilitites:

1. Add Friends
2. Compare Favorites
3. Find local bars that serve your favorite beers
4. Beer Rating
5. Beer Reviews
